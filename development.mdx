  **Prerequisites** - You should have these installed:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€¢ To edit the code
    - [Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SanaAjani.taskrunnercode) â€¢ For running & terminating tasks
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) â€¢ For commiting/uploading code to our repository
    - [VSCode GLua Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=venner.vscode-glua-enhanced) â€¢ Syntax highlighting
    - [Node.JS LTS/Current](https://nodejs.org/en) â€¢ Used for versioning & pre-commit hooks

</Info>

Step 1. Clone the desired server (ImperialRP/CloneWarsRP) to your desired location:

```bash Git Bash
git clone https://github.com/WerewolfGaming/<ImperialRP/CloneWarsRP> game-server
```

Step 2. Go to the newly created `game-server` directory, install all of the NPM packages & open visual studio code.

```bash Git Bash
cd game-server
npm i
code .
```

<Tip>
  Having issues installing the server due to error 0x602? Then checkout [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
</Tip>

Step 3. If you have the "Task Runner" extension installed in VSCode, you can simply press "Download Server" in the task list to run the "DownloadServer" script. If not, then you can do the following

```ps PowerShell
./_scripts/install_server.ps1
```

<Info>
  You can choose to start the server via GMRDB, whick will enable debugging mode, giving you access to things such as [breakpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint)!
</Info>
Step 4. Once the server is installed, press F5 to start debugging. The server will now auto start and you will auto connect to it. If you do not auto connect ensure no gmod instances are running. You can use the connect to server task to auto connect again.

```ps PowerShell
./_scripts/run_server.ps1
```

Step 5. You are all done! ðŸŽ‰<br />

      You can safely ignore any errors that you may see whilst installing [GMOD-Development-Environment](https://github.com/8char/GMOD-Development-Environment) pertaining to the Atlas Framework installation
    </Info>
    1. Go and clone the [GMOD-Development-Environment](https://github.com/8char/GMOD-Development-Environment) repository.
    2. Run the install scripts via task runner in vscode.
    3. Copy over the `gmod` directory once it has installed in the `_scripts` directory in [GMOD-Development-Environment](https://github.com/8char/GMOD-Development-Environment) over to your `game-server/_server` directory.
    4. Delete the following directories from `game-server/_server`: `lua`, `maps`, `gamemodes`, `cfg` & `addons`
    5. Run the junction creator script:
    ```bash Git Bash
